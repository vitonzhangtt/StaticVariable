## Translation units(compilation units)
"Programmers usually deal with header files and implementation files. 
Compilers don’t – they deal with translation units (TUs), sometimes 
referred to as compilation units. The definition of such a translation 
unit is very simple: Any file, fed to the compiler, after it has been 
pre-processed. In detail, this means that it is the file resulting 
from the pre-processor expanding macros, conditionally including 
source code depending on #ifdef and #ifndef statements and copy-pasting 
any #includeed files."
